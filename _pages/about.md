I am an economist interested in how information and strategic interactions shape competitive markets. My research spans industrial organization, economic theory, and game theory, particularly examining how firms' decisions to share or withhold information influence market structures, consumer welfare, and regulatory policies.

I focus on auction-based markets, especially public procurement, investigating how seemingly disadvantageous conditions, like fewer competitors, can sometimes enhance buyer surplus, and how informational frictions affect firms' strategic behavior. Recent work-in-progress examines platform intermediaries' strategic choices between merchant and agency business models, highlighting the trade-off between market efficiency and growth potential.

I have taught Microeconomics, Industrial Organization, and Game Theory at the University of Rome Tor Vergata and at Luiss "Guido Carli".

I earned my Ph.D. in Economics and Finance from the University of Rome Tor Vergata in 2025, following an MSc in Economics at Tor Vergata (2018) and an MSc in Philosophy of the Social Sciences from the London School of Economics (2016).
